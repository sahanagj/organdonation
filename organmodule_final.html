<center><h1>Heart donation</h1></center>
<ul>
<li>A donor heart can only come from an individual who is declared brain dead and on a ventilator.
<li>Donated hearts are allocated to patients based on medical urgency, size match, blood group compatibility and time on the waiting list.
<li>Transplant recipients may take a number of medications after transplant, many for the rest of their lives. The medications help reduce the risk of complications after transplant.
<li>Heart transplant surgery may be considered if you have severe heart failure. If your condition is serious and other treatments are not managing to improve things or control your symptoms, your cardiologist may send you to a heart transplant centre for a transplant assessment.  
<li>When cosidering whether a heart is a good match, the team will look at the quality of the heart, the size, and importantly, how well it matches your blood and tissue type.
If you are considered suitable for a heart transplant you will be added to the transplant waiting list.

<center><h1>Liver Donation</h1></center>
<ul>
<li> Live Donor Liver Transplantation (LDLT) is a procedure in which a live donor gives a portion of his or her liver to a family member or friend in need of a liver transplant.
<li>Live donor liver transplantation is possible because the liver, unique among organs in humans, will regenerate. This means that when part of a liver is taken from a live liver donor for transplantation, the portion that remains in the donor can regenerate to its original size – and the portion transplanted into the recipient will regenerate to a size that fits the recipient's body.
<li>Potential liver donors qualify by having no serious medical condition such as liver disease, diabetes, heart disease, or cancer.
<li>A patient with blood type “O” can only receive a liver from a donor who is also blood type “O.” Patients with blood type “AB” may receive a liver from donors of any blood type.  Patients with blood type “A” need a liver donor who is “O” or “A” and patients with blood type “B” need a donor who is “O” or “B.”
<li>Live Donor Liver Transplant is an elective procedure performed when the recipient is in the "best" possible condition, he or she avoids the continued physical deterioration that inevitably occurs while waiting for a suitable liver replacement.

<center><h1>Cornea Donation</h1></center>
<ul>
<li>Eye donation involves donating your corneas – not your iris.
<li>This small and simple part of the eye is hugely important for thousands of cornea transplants a year, often saving the sight of patients for many years.
<li>A cornea transplant makes a lasting difference to people’s lives and is a relatively quick procedure. Depending on which type of corneal transplant people need, and how much of the cornea needs replacing, the transplant can be completed in under an hour.
<li>Cornea transplants usually have a very good chance of success. Around 93% of transplants continue to function after one year. By five years, 74% of transplants are still working well and many will continue for many more years after that.
<li> The process of cornea donation starts with an individual’s decision to be an eye, tissue, and organ donor, or a family’s consent to donation, and then results in a cornea transplant for a patient suffering from corneal blindness.
</ul>
<h1 align="center">Facts about Cornea</h1>

<center><h1>Lungs Donation</h1></center>
<ul>
<li>A lung transplant is a surgical procedure to replace a diseased or failing lung with a healthy lung. 
<li> The transplanted lung almost always comes from a deceased donor; however, a partial lung transplant is possible from a living donor. 
<li>Lung damage can often be treated with medication or with special breathing devices. If these measures no longer help or your lung function becomes life-threatening, your doctor might suggest a lung transplant.
<li>A lung transplant usually takes between four and 12 hours to complete, depending on the complexity of the operation.
<li>A lung transplant is a major operation that may take at least three months to recover from.
</ul>
<h1 align="center">Facts about Lungs</h1>
<ul>
    <li>Both lungs contain 200 to 500 alveoli
    <li>Lung on left side is slightly smaller to right side

<div class="desc" id="pancreas">
<center><h1>Pancreas Donation</h1></center>
<ul>
<li>A Pancreas transplant is typically reserved for those who have serious diabetes complications. A pancreas transplant is often done in conjunction with a kidney transplant.
<li>Pancreas transplant patients may be in the intensive care unit for a few days and spend, on average, a week in the hospital.
<li>An individual without a properly functioning pancreas does not have the necessary amount of insulin being produced in their bodies, and thus, there is a surplus sugar in their blood. 
<li>This can cause major problems in the body, such as kidney failure, heart disease, strokes or even death. The most common cause of pancreas disease is Type I Diabetes, formerly known as juvenile diabetes.
<li>It is common for a patient to be waiting for both a pancreas and a kidney transplant simultaneously, as the issues related to a malfunctioning pancreas also result in the need for a new kidney.
</ul>
<h1 align="center">Facts about Pancreas</h1>
<ul>
 <li>Helps control blood sugar
 <li>Makes digestive enzymes which help digest the food
 <li>Produces hormones that passes into the blood
 <li>Allows body cells to use glucose
 <li>It is a rubbery gland and has a pale color

<div class="desc" id="intestine">
<center><h1>Intestine Donation</h1></center>
<ul>
<li>An intestine transplant is a last resort treatment option for patients with intestinal failure who develop life-threatening complications.
<li>In intestinal failure, the intestines can no longer digest food or absorb the fluids, electrolytes and nutrients essential for life. Patients must receive total parenteral nutrition (TPN), which provides liquid nutrition through a catheter or needle inserted into the body. 
<li>An intestine transplant may involve the whole intestine or an intestine segment. 
<li>Transplant recipients may take a number of medications after transplant, many for the rest of their lives. The medications help reduce the risk of complications after transplant.
<li>Without a transplant, many patients cannot eat solid foods or live a normal life. The gift of an intestine donation has the potential to restore a recipient's capacity to thrive physically and emotionally.
</ul>
<h1 align="center">Facts about Intestine</h1>
<ul>
<li>Food can be inside small intestine from 1 to 5 hours
<li>Water content gets absorbed by large intestine
<li>Small intestine consists of ileum, jejunum and duodenum.
<li>Small intestine absorbs nutrients of the food
<li>Large intestine is responsible for excretion
